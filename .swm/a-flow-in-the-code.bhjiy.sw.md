## Introduction

This doc describes the {{SUBJECT}} flow in our system. We will follow its implementation across the various locations so you can understand how the different parts create the full picture.

<br/>

<br/>

This is where the starting place of the project and where the main code will be added to run the producer and consumer.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ MultiThread/src/com/nbui/Main.java
```java
3      public class Main {
4      
5          public static void main(String[] args) {
6      	// write your code here
7          }
8      }
```

<br/>

## Producer-Consumer class

<br/>

<br/>

This class will hold the methods for the producer and consumer to be used.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ MultiThread/src/com/nbui/Producer_consumer.java
```java
5      public class Producer_consumer {
6          LinkedList<Integer> testList = new LinkedList<>();
7          int capacity = 2;
8      
9          public void produce() throws InterruptedException {
10             int value = 0;
11             while(true) {
12                 synchronized (this){
13                     while(testList.size() == capacity)
14                         wait();
15                     System.out.println("Producer produced-" + value);
16     
17                     testList.add(value++);
18     
19                     notify();
20     
21                     Thread.sleep(1000);
22                 }
23             }
24         }
25     }
```
